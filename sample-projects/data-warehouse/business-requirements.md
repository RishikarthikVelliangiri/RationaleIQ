# Data Warehouse & Analytics Platform - Business Requirements

## Executive Sponsor
**CFO Jennifer Martinez**

## Business Problem
Our current analytics capabilities are severely limited. Business teams spend 40% of their time manually pulling data from multiple sources, creating Excel reports, and reconciling discrepancies. Critical business questions take days or weeks to answer.

### Pain Points Identified

**1. Finance Team (CFO, Controllers, Analysts)**
> "I need to combine data from Salesforce, Stripe, and our internal order system just to calculate monthly recurring revenue. It takes 2 days and the data is already outdated." - Finance Analyst

**Current process:**
- Export CSV from Salesforce
- Export transactions from Stripe
- Query production database for orders
- Manual Excel reconciliation
- Create pivot tables and charts
- **Time required:** 16 hours/month per analyst (3 analysts)

**2. Product Team**
> "We can't answer basic questions like 'which features drive retention?' without asking engineering to write custom SQL queries." - Head of Product

**Limitations:**
- No self-service analytics
- Dependent on engineering for data access
- Can't track feature usage across product
- No cohort analysis capabilities

**3. Marketing Team**
> "Our attribution is a mess. We don't know which campaigns actually drive revenue." - VP Marketing

**Issues:**
- Google Analytics not connected to revenue data
- Can't track customer journey across touchpoints
- No way to calculate CAC by channel
- Marketing spend ROI unknown

**4. Executive Team**
> "I need a single source of truth for KPIs. Right now, every department has different numbers." - CEO

**Problems:**
- Finance says ARR is $12.3M
- Sales says ARR is $13.1M
- Product says active customers are 4,500
- Marketing says active customers are 5,200
- Nobody trusts the numbers

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goal
Create a unified data warehouse that serves as the single source of truth for all business analytics.

### Key Results (Success Metrics)

   - Current: 2-3 days for ad-hoc analysis
   - Target: 2-3 hours

2. **Enable self-service analytics**
   - 80% of common questions answered without engineering
   - Non-technical users can create their own reports

3. **Improve data accuracy**
   - Eliminate discrepancies in key metrics
   - Automated data quality checks
   - Single source of truth for all KPIs

4. **Free up engineering time**
   - Current: 15 hours/week spent on ad-hoc data requests
   - Target: < 3 hours/week

5. **Better business decisions**
   - Data-driven decision making
   - Real-time KPI monitoring
   - Predictive analytics capabilities
