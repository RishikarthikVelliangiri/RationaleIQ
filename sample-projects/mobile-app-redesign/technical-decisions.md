# Technical Decision Log - Mobile App Redesign

## Decision 1: Framework Choice
**Date:** January 10, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Decided

### Context
Current app built on React Native 0.59 (released 2019). Need to decide: upgrade React Native, go native, or migrate to Flutter?

### Options Evaluated
1. **React Native Upgrade (0.59 → 0.73)**
   - Leverage existing codebase and team knowledge
   - Significant breaking changes require extensive refactoring
   - Access to latest performance improvements
   
2. **Native Development (Swift + Kotlin)**
   - Best-in-class performance and UX
   - Two separate codebases, higher maintenance cost
   - Longer development timeline
   
3. **Flutter Migration**
   - Modern framework with excellent performance
   - Steep learning curve for team
   - Growing but smaller ecosystem than React Native

### Decision
**Selected: React Native Upgrade**

**Rationale:**
- Team already proficient in React/JavaScript
- 60% of existing code can be reused with modifications
- Time-to-market critical (6 months vs 9 months for native)
- Recent RN improvements address our performance concerns
- Hermes engine provides significant performance boost

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- Not quite as performant as native (but good enough for our use case)
- Still dependent on Meta's React Native roadmap
- Some platform-specific UI compromises

## Decision 2: State Management
**Date:** January 12, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Decided

### Context
Current app uses Redux with redux-thunk. Considering modern alternatives.

### Options
1. **Redux Toolkit** - Modern Redux with less boilerplate
2. **Zustand** - Lightweight, simple state management
3. **Recoil** - Atom-based state management from Meta
4. **React Query + Context** - Server state vs client state separation

### Decision
**Selected: React Query + Zustand**

**Rationale:**
- React Query handles server state elegantly (caching, refetching, optimistic updates)
- Zustand for simple client state (UI state, user preferences)
- Reduces boilerplate by 70% compared to current Redux setup
- Better separation of concerns

## Decision 3: Payment Integration
**Date:** January 14, 2025
**Status:** ⏸️ Pending

### Context
Need to support Apple Pay, Google Pay, and traditional card payments. Current implementation uses Stripe only.

### Options Under Consideration
1. **Stripe Payment Sheet** - Stripe's pre-built native UI
2. **Braintree** - PayPal-owned, supports multiple payment methods
3. **Custom implementation** - Full control but more development

### Pending Questions
- Do we need to support PayPal directly?
- What's the priority for international payment methods?
- Compliance requirements for different regions?

**Next Step:** Meeting with Finance team Jan 18

## Decision 4: Offline Support
**Date:** January 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Decided

### Context
Users report frustration when browsing products without internet. Need offline capability.

### Decision
**Implement progressive offline support:**

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- Cache product images locally
- Save cart items locally
- Show previously viewed products offline
- Clear "offline mode" indicator

**Phase 2 (Future):**
- Offline browse of full catalog
- Queue actions for when online (add to cart, etc.)
- Sync favorites and wishlist

**Not Implementing:**
- Full offline checkout (too complex, security concerns)
- Offline price updates (need real-time pricing)

**Technical Approach:**
- Use React Query's cache persistence
- Implement service worker for asset caching
- NetInfo for network status detection

## Decision 5: Analytics & Monitoring
**Date:** January 16, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Decided

### Decision
**Analytics Stack:**
- Firebase Analytics (user behavior, funnels)
- Sentry (error tracking, crash reporting)
- Custom performance monitoring (load times, rendering)

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Screen load times (p50, p95, p99)
- API response times
- Crash-free sessions rate
- User flow completion rates
- Cart abandonment funnel

**Rationale:**
- Firebase free tier sufficient for current scale
- Sentry provides excellent React Native support
- Need granular performance data to validate redesign success

## Decision 6: Design System
**Date:** January 17, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Decided

### Decision
**Build custom design system based on React Native Paper**

**Components:**
- Extend React Native Paper components
- Custom theme matching brand guidelines
- Platform-specific adaptations where needed
- Storybook for component documentation

**Rationale:**
- React Native Paper provides solid foundation
- Customization needed to match brand
- Consistent components across app
- Faster development than building from scratch

**Trade-off:**
- More effort than using library as-is
- Need to maintain custom components
- Worth it for brand consistency and UX quality
