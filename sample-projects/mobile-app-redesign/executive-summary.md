# Mobile App Redesign - Executive Summary

## Business Context
Our mobile app has a 2.3-star rating on app stores, significantly below industry average (4.2 stars). Customer complaints focus on slow performance, confusing navigation, and frequent crashes.

## Problem Statement
The current mobile app was built 4 years ago using React Native 0.59. It's outdated, difficult to maintain, and provides a poor user experience that's hurting customer retention.

## Key Metrics (Current State)
- App store rating: 2.3/5.0 stars
- Daily active users: 45,000 (down 15% YoY)
- Crash rate: 3.2% (industry benchmark: <1%)
- Average session duration: 2.1 minutes (down from 4.5 minutes last year)
- Cart abandonment rate: 68% (desktop: 42%)

## Proposed Solution
Complete redesign and rebuild of mobile application with focus on:
1. Modern UI/UX following platform guidelines (iOS HIG, Material Design)
2. Performance optimization (target <2s load time)
3. Offline-first architecture
4. Improved checkout flow

## Strategic Options

### Option A: Native Development
Build separate iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) apps
- Investment: $800K
- Timeline: 9 months
- Pros: Best performance, platform-native UX
- Cons: Higher cost, two codebases to maintain

### Option B: React Native Upgrade
Upgrade to latest React Native, comprehensive redesign
- Investment: $450K
- Timeline: 6 months
- Pros: Single codebase, team familiarity
- Cons: Still dependent on cross-platform framework

### Option C: Flutter Migration
Migrate to Flutter framework
- Investment: $520K
- Timeline: 7 months
- Pros: Excellent performance, modern framework
- Cons: Team learning curve, new technology

## Expected Outcomes
- Improve app store rating to 4.0+ stars
- Increase DAU by 30%
- Reduce crash rate to <0.5%
- Increase mobile conversion rate by 25%

## Recommendation
Proceed with Option B (React Native Upgrade) based on time-to-market urgency and team expertise.
