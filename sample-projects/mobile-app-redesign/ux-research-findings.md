# UX Research Findings - Mobile App Study

## Research Methodology
- User interviews: 25 participants (existing customers)
- Usability testing: 15 participants (mix of existing and potential customers)
- Survey responses: 1,200+ customers
- Analytics review: 3 months of user behavior data

## Key Findings

### 1. Navigation Complexity
**Problem:** Users get lost trying to find products or their account settings.

> "I can never remember where the order history is. Sometimes it's in the menu, sometimes it's in my profile?" - Participant #7

**Data:** 
- 45% of users abandon the app without completing their intended task
- Average of 12 taps required to reach checkout (industry best practice: 4-6 taps)

### 2. Performance Issues
**Problem:** Slow load times and laggy interactions frustrate users.

> "By the time the product photos load, I've already opened Amazon on my laptop." - Participant #12

**Data:**
- Average product page load: 6.2 seconds
- Image loading issues reported by 68% of survey respondents
- App freezes during search reported by 41% of users

### 3. Checkout Flow Friction
**Problem:** Multi-step checkout process has too many steps and confusing form fields.

**Pain points identified:**
- Credit card form doesn't support autofill (massive complaint)
- Address validation too strict (rejects valid addresses)
- Shipping options unclear
- Coupon code field hidden and hard to find

**Data:**
- 68% cart abandonment on mobile vs 42% on desktop
- Users spend average 4.5 minutes in checkout (desktop: 2.1 minutes)

### 4. Search Functionality
**Problem:** Search results are irrelevant and filters don't work well.

> "I searched for 'blue running shoes' and got dress shoes, sandals, and a blue t-shirt. Nothing I actually wanted." - Participant #19

**Data:**
- 58% of searches result in zero clicks on results
- Users scroll past first 10 results only 12% of the time
- Filter usage: only 8% of users apply filters (should be 40%+)
