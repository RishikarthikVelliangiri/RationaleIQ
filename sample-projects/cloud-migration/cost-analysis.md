# Cloud Migration Cost Analysis

## Current State (On-Premises)

### Monthly Costs
| Category | Cost | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Colocation Space | $8,000 | 12 racks |

## Hidden Benefits (Not in Cost Savings)

1. **Scalability:** Handle 10x traffic spikes (Black Friday) without infrastructure changes
2. **Speed:** Provision new environments in minutes vs weeks
3. **Compliance:** SOC 2 compliance enables enterprise sales ($500K+ opportunity)
4. **Reliability:** Multi-AZ setup improves uptime from 99.5% to 99.95%
5. **Innovation:** Free up engineering time for feature development

## Recommendation

**Phased Approach (Option 2 â†’ Option 3):**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** Replatform Migration
- Investment: $180,000
- Monthly savings: $19,250
- Annual savings: $231,000

**Phase 2 (Months 7-15):** Gradual Containerization
- Additional investment: $150,000 (incremental)
- Monthly savings increase to: $20,650
- Annual savings: $235,800

**Total Investment:** $330,000
**Break-even:** ~15 months
**3-Year Net Savings:** $377,400

This approach balances risk, timeline, and cost optimization while avoiding the upfront capital expenditure of $260K for hardware refresh.
