# Cloud Migration Strategy - Legacy Infrastructure to AWS

## Executive Summary
Migrate on-premises infrastructure to AWS cloud to reduce costs, improve scalability, and enable faster feature deployment.

## Current Infrastructure
- 12 physical servers in colocation facility
- Monthly colocation cost: $18,000
- Hardware age: 4-7 years (approaching end of life)
- OS: Mix of Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 7 (both approaching EOL)
- Scaling challenges: 2-3 week lead time for new capacity

## Business Drivers
1. **Cost Reduction:** Colocation contract up for renewal at 20% increase
2. **Scalability:** Unable to handle seasonal traffic spikes (Black Friday, holidays)
3. **Agility:** Current provisioning time blocks rapid feature deployment
4. **Reliability:** Hardware failures increasing (3 incidents last quarter)
5. **Compliance:** Need SOC 2 compliance for enterprise customers

## Migration Strategy Options

### Option 1: Lift and Shift
Move existing VMs to AWS EC2 with minimal changes

**Pros:**
- Fastest migration (3-4 months)
- Lowest risk
- Team familiarity with existing setup

**Cons:**
- Minimal cost savings (~15%)
- Doesn't leverage cloud-native benefits
- Technical debt carried forward

**Estimated Cost:** $12,000/month AWS spend

### Option 2: Replatform
Migrate to managed services (RDS, ElastiCache, etc.) where possible

**Pros:**
- Moderate risk
- 40% cost savings through rightsizing
- Reduced operational overhead
- Better scalability

**Cons:**
- Longer migration (6-8 months)
- Some application changes required
- Team learning curve on AWS services

**Estimated Cost:** $8,500/month AWS spend

### Option 3: Refactor to Containerized Microservices
Full modernization using ECS/Kubernetes

**Pros:**
- Maximum cost efficiency (50% savings)
- Best long-term scalability
- Modern DevOps practices

**Cons:**
- Highest risk
- Longest timeline (12-15 months)
- Significant application rewrites needed
- Requires team upskilling

**Estimated Cost:** $7,200/month AWS spend (after optimization)

## Recommended Approach: Phased Hybrid

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Months 1-2)
- Migrate static assets to S3/CloudFront
- Move databases to RDS
- Implement CloudWatch monitoring
- **Risk:** Low | **Cost Impact:** -$2,000/month

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Months 3-6)
- Migrate application servers to EC2
- Implement Auto Scaling Groups
- Set up Application Load Balancer
- Migrate Redis to ElastiCache
- **Risk:** Medium | **Cost Impact:** -$5,000/month additional

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 7-9)
- Containerize applications
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Enable multi-AZ deployments
- Security hardening and compliance
- **Risk:** Medium | **Cost Impact:** -$3,000/month additional

## Key Technical Decisions Required

### 1. Compute: EC2 vs ECS vs Lambda
**Current thinking:** 
- EC2 for stateful applications (Phase 2)
- ECS for microservices (Phase 3)
- Lambda for event-driven workloads (Phase 3)

### 2. Database Strategy
**Options:**
- **RDS PostgreSQL** - Managed database, automated backups, multi-AZ
- **Aurora PostgreSQL** - Better performance, higher cost
- **Self-managed on EC2** - Maximum control, operational overhead

**Recommendation:** Start with RDS, evaluate Aurora if performance issues

### 3. Networking Architecture
**Decisions needed:**
- VPC design (single vs multi-VPC)
- Subnet strategy (public/private/data tiers)
- Hybrid connectivity (Direct Connect vs VPN)
- DNS strategy (Route 53 setup)

### 4. Security & Compliance
- IAM role strategy
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secret management (AWS Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store)
- Security groups and NACLs
- VPC Flow Logs and CloudTrail

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
1. **Data Migration Failure:** Database migration could result in data loss
   - *Mitigation:* Extensive testing, gradual cutover, backup strategy
   
2. **Performance Degradation:** Cloud environment performs worse than on-prem
   - *Mitigation:* Load testing, performance baseline, rightsizing
   
3. **Cost Overruns:** AWS bill exceeds projections
   - *Mitigation:* Cost monitoring, reserved instances, strict tagging

### Medium Risks
1. **Team Knowledge Gaps:** Limited AWS expertise in team
   - *Mitigation:* Training program, AWS consultant engagement
   
2. **Downtime During Migration:** Customer-facing downtime
   - *Mitigation:* Blue-green deployment, DNS cutover strategy

## Success Criteria
- Zero data loss during migration
- â‰¤2 hours downtime for cutover
- 30% cost reduction in year 1
- 99.9% uptime post-migration
- SOC 2 compliance achieved within 6 months
