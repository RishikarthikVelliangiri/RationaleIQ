# Technical Requirements - E-Commerce Platform

## System Architecture
We need to decide between the following architectural approaches:

### Option 1: Full Microservices
- Complete decomposition into independent services
- Pros: Maximum scalability, independent deployment
- Cons: Higher complexity, increased operational overhead
- Estimated cost: $2.5M

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach
- Keep core functionality monolithic, extract high-traffic features
- Pros: Balanced complexity, faster migration
- Cons: Some technical debt remains
- Estimated cost: $1.8M

### Option 3: Modular Monolith
- Restructure existing codebase with clear module boundaries
- Pros: Lower risk, easier to manage
- Cons: Limited scalability improvements
- Estimated cost: $1.2M

## Technology Stack Considerations

### Backend Framework Decision
**Node.js vs Java Spring Boot vs .NET Core**

Current system runs on PHP 7.x. We need to choose a modern backend framework.

Factors to consider:
- Team expertise (currently 60% JavaScript, 30% Java, 10% .NET)
- Performance requirements (handle 10,000 requests/second)
- Third-party integration ecosystem
- Long-term maintainability

### Database Strategy
**PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs Hybrid approach**

Current: MySQL 5.7

Requirements:
- Support for complex transactions (orders, payments)
- Product catalog flexibility
- Real-time analytics capabilities
- ACID compliance for financial transactions

## Performance Requirements
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- API response time: < 200ms (p95)
- System uptime: 99.9%
- Support 100,000 concurrent users

## Security Requirements
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- GDPR compliance for EU customers
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
