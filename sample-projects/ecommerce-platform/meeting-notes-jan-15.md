# Architecture Review Meeting - January 15, 2025

## Attendees
- Sarah Johnson (CTO)
- Mike Chen (VP Engineering)
- David Kim (Lead Architect)
- Lisa Rodriguez (Product Manager)
- Team leads from Platform, Frontend, and DevOps

## Key Discussion Points

### Microservices vs Monolith Debate
Mike advocated strongly for Option 1 (Full Microservices), citing Amazon and Netflix as success stories. He believes we need to "go all in" to stay competitive.

David pushed back, noting our team's limited experience with distributed systems. He recommended Option 2 (Hybrid) as a pragmatic middle ground. "We're not Amazon," he said, "and we don't need to solve problems we don't have yet."

Lisa emphasized business needs: we need to ship new features faster, particularly mobile improvements. She's concerned that a full microservices migration could delay feature development by 6+ months.

Sarah asked tough questions about operational complexity. "Do we have the DevOps capacity to manage 20+ independent services?" Current team: 3 DevOps engineers.

### Technology Stack Decision
Consensus emerging around Node.js for new services:
- Leverages existing JavaScript expertise
- Rich ecosystem for e-commerce (Stripe, Shopify integrations)
- Strong community support
- Good performance for I/O-heavy operations

Java Spring Boot was considered but team expertise is limited. We'd need to hire or train extensively.

### Database Discussion
Strong disagreement on database strategy:

**David's position:** Stick with PostgreSQL for everything. It's proven, ACID-compliant, and the team knows it well. "Let's not add complexity by mixing databases."

**Mike's position:** Use MongoDB for product catalog (flexibility for varying product attributes), PostgreSQL for transactions and orders. "Right tool for the job."

**Concerns raised:** Managing data consistency across multiple databases, increased operational complexity, team learning curve.

## Decisions Made
1. ✅ Proceed with Hybrid Approach (Option 2)
2. ✅ Node.js as primary backend framework for new services
3. ⏸️ Database strategy - need more research, decision deferred to next meeting

## Action Items
- David: Create detailed migration roadmap for hybrid approach (Due: Jan 22)
- Mike: Research and present database consistency strategies (Due: Jan 22)
- DevOps team: Assess infrastructure requirements for 5-10 services (Due: Jan 29)
- Lisa: Prioritize feature roadmap aligned with migration timeline (Due: Jan 22)

## Next Meeting
January 22, 2025 - Final architecture decision and sign-off
